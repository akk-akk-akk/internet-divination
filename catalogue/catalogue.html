                                        how hard it is to
                                        memorise a script! I decided eventually to lean into the script reading as part
                                        of the character. I
                                        honestly ended up doing so many takes because I kept messing up or the tone
                                        wasn't right. I was also
                                        worried that the audio might be echo-ey as the studio was quite empty and
                                        resonant.

                                        There were many firsts here, and I had to just trust my instincts and pray that
                                        anything wrong could
                                        be fixed in post.
