              <p>To be honest, I was a little sad that I wasn't able to show more for the sharing, as my making had not
                progressed much. Most of the work I had done in the past few weeks remained in my illustrator files and
                dissertation. I shared what I had as best as I could (slides, plans, ideas.).
                <br><br>
                Also, it was quite inspiring to see what everyone was working on. I felt like maybe a part of my
                unmotivation was also not having felt a sense of community for a while, and seeing everyone working and
                being creative with their work got me excited to get back into the work again.

              <h2>Feedback</h2>
              <p>I did get feedback on my pixel oracle setup from last week. Andreas suggested that it was very
                conceptual and might be a little difficult to understand, as opposed to the initial website, which he
                found more interesting. I didn't take that immediately as a 'no', as I felt like it was okay for work to
                challenge both myself and the audience without having to be "interesting" all the time. BUT, I
                understand that the work still needs to capture the attention of the audience, so I will sit on that
                feedback.
                <br><br>
                Other than that, I was urged to FINISH MY CPJ! and also start thinking of my open studios set-up and
                show my research/experiment so far. Hopefully in writing my CPJ, I will be able to make more sense of
                what I've done so far.

                  <p>At some point in doing my CPJ, I remembered stumbling upon the setup wizard. Back when I first
                    started using the computer, softwares often started with a wizard that helped me to install my
                    programmes. I never really questioned why it was a wizard except for the fact that it magically
                    completed the task for me — which was perhaps exactly the point. Calling it was likely meant to say
                    "don't worry about how we did it, it's just magic!"

                  <p>The specific instance of the wizard I was concerned with here was Merlin, of course. He was a
                    character used as a representation of a Microsoft agent in 2003, a step taken towards the
                    personification of the setup wizard. It is interesting how the language of magic has always been
                    used in technology as a means of completing complicated processes without having to understand it
                    fully (like magic!). It definitely paints an innocent and fantastical image to have a wizard do your
                    digital chores for you. While it remains so, does it prime itself as something that prevents us from
                    wanting to peek behind the curtains?</p>

                    <h2>Reconciling Dissonance with Audiences</h2>
                    <p>
                      As one of the most famous wizards in pop culture, even having its own TV show and Disney character, I figured Merlin would be the perfect narrator for the story I'm telling. I asked my
                      friends if they remember who Merlin was, and most don't immediately recall the character, but
                      eventually do when I show them the wizard in the pop-up box.
                      <br><br>
                      As discussed before, the challenge of any discursive project that is not immediately understandable is to help the user reconcile with the dissonance presented to them.
                      <b>By hinging on the nostalgia of the character, I hope to  invite the audience into this world — a world where magic and technology has never been that far apart.</b> The memory of Merlin might just be the key to the story I'm telling.
