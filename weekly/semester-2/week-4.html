              <p>In this week's consultation, I expressed to Andreas my concerns over how to present and categorise the
                work I've done, and how to move forward. Personally, I haven't been strict with differenciating
                experiments and prototypes as I felt like they were arbitrary distinctions. However, I recognise that
                the distinction would help make sense of my work for others as well.

                  <p>
                    I refer to Dunne and Raby's definition of "thought experiments", which I think are most of my
                    experiments, particularly the Pixel Oracle and Meme Oracle. In which the priority is less to create
                    complete narratives or coherent worlds, but to explore unconventional ideas through design
                    (sometimes absurd), with the hope of finding new ways to discuss technology. In this case, my
                    rearticulating the practices with elements from divinatory practices, I am able to discuss ideas of
                    faith, belief, and doublethink.

              <h1>The Experience / Interactive Installation</h1>
              <p>At the end of the consult, Andreas and I agreed that my next step should be to plan the interactive
                experience. I'm not sure what the experience will be yet, but it will likely be an extension of my Meme
                Oracle, interview-style activity. I think I want to lean into a more imaginative narrative, where I can
                tell a story of a future where AI becomes regarded as gods, or a similar all-knowing entity.
                <br><br>
                I started brainstorming some themes that I could use to create a world for the audience...

              <h2>Evangelism</h2>
              <p>I stumbled upon some pictures of evangelists holding up signs, and thought about what it would look
                like if belief in AI was pushed in a similar manner. There is an absurdity and humour about the language
                that I could use to make known how silly it is for us to put our full faith in AI.

              <h2>Cult</h2>
              <p>I've recently been watching Severance, a TV show with cult-like themes. There is also the idea of
                brainwashing through soft control. It also has a certain tech-futurism about it that I quite enjoy. This
                all lends to a creepy atmosphere around something that seems to be normalised in the world that the
                creators have built. This hopefully also imparts a sense of wary that we probably should always have towards corporate AI companies.
