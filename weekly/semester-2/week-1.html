              <p>I began the new semester by reflecting on the previous semester and the feedback I received. Overall,
                I'm relieved that the "weirdness" of the project was well-received. I was initially worried that it
                would be regarded as nonsensical. I think putting my research into a book and explaining my thought
                process behind the absurdity helped convey my message. I came up with some actionables for myself based
                on the feedback and my own reflection over the break.

              <h2>1. Formats of presentation</h2>
              <p> While the thought processes were important to my outcomes, I was advised by both markers to think of
                how to cut down on the heaviness of the content, or at least to find better ways to present them. I
                thought about how to create better entry points for the audience. This would mean reconsidering the
                hierarchy of content overall. Marker 1 suggested considering how to "create an engaging and accessible
                entry point for your audience with little supporting text while offering deeper insights for those who
                want to explore and read further?"</p>

                that tells a story – that could even be imaginative or whimsical. I'm sure that also makes the whole

              <p>My project currently lives entirely in the digital, except for the "interview"-style reading I
                conducted for the meme tarot activity. I wondered if there were ways to better present my projects,
                with interaction, that allowed for the participant to be more engaged with the subject matter. This
                could be through video, interaction, etc. Another consideration for this would be for open studio/viva
                voce presentation. Ideally I would like the physical presentation to be more dynamic and interesting,
                rather than just screens and print outs. I haven't decided what that means exactly yet, but I'm
                keeping this in mind. I am reminded of my table setups in my exchange school. I've learnt that it is
                definitely way more interesting to have setups that present your work in contrasting ways, and that is
                something I would try to do for my project as well.</p>

                <h2>Primitive Representations of the Divine</h2>
                <p>I rediscovered a reading I found earlier in the first semester called "Robot Saints." In it, the
                  writer researches the first manifestations of robots in religious settings, often used as a
                  personification of saints. Through different modes of entertainment (procession, puppetry, chant,
                  instrumentation, song, and epic
                  poetry), automation was used by craftsmen to convince audiences they are witnessing miraculous
                  transformations.
                  <br><br>
                  <i>"Faith functions by way of transfer:
                    the transfer of a certain set of expectations (such as “God is listening”) into
                    a category that does not intuitively apply to that category (“a carved piece of
                    wood is listening”)."</i>
                  <br><br>
                  As the studies occured at the time of medieval Europe, peoples' understanding of automative technology
                  were more primitive. The robots' ability to mimick biological realism thus made them especially
                  effective as representations of the divine – devotional tools. Notably, the practice of doublethink is
                  used, as the audience might be aware of the robot's mechanical nature, but still believes in its
                  divinity. This is perhaps attributed in part to the unfamiliarity with robots, but also largely a
                  suspension of belief for one's healing.

                  <h2>Primitive Representations of AI</h2>
                  <p>Arguably, AI is in its primitive stage as well. Many are not too familiar with its inner workings
                    and that is the reason for both its malice and magic. There is perhaps value in the personification
                    of AI as a way to "enhance" the way we perceive it as a figure of trust and guidance. As spoken of
                    before, the language and visual cues are very much designed with intention, whether its to sound
                    more human or not.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>"In the avant-garde theater
                    movements of the early twentieth century, the robot was understood in a similar way: a useful object
                    that held the interest of spectators because of its capacity to blur boundaries between manufactured
                    and biological things."</i>
                    <br><br>
                    How are similar boundaries blurred in the way we interact with AI today? How are our current
                    understandings, or lack thereof, of AI shaping the way we receive its information?
