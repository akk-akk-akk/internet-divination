              <p>I started the week preparing to film my video at Winstead, where I had booked a slot for the photo
                studio. I had 3 hours (10am-1pm) and no time to waste! The plan was to film Act 2 of the script I wrote
                last week,
                and some B-roll for editing.

              <p>The setup involved a lot of testing, especially since the studio did not have the continuous lights
                that I needed, and didn't have a room with natural light. I fortunately found an old floodlight in
                my house that was bright enough for the job.<b> So I had 3 sources of light (ceiling, floodlight, and a
                  table lamp I had brought).</b></p>

                  <p>This was my first time being in front of the camera for a video, and I realised how hard it is to
                    memorise a script! I decided eventually to lean into the script reading as part of the character. I
                    honestly ended up doing so many takes because I kept messing up or the tone wasn't right. I was also
                    worried that the audio might be echo-ey as the studio was quite empty and resonant.

                    There were many firsts here, and I had to just trust my instincts and pray that anything wrong could
                    be fixed in post.
