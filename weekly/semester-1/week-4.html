              <p>
                I created a mindmap for the class activity. This time, I delved more into the aspect of neutrality by
                exploring the <b>creator, middle man, and receiver of information.</b> I felt like this made it clearer
                for me to study how spiritual information is created, mediated/manipulated, and then received and
                interpreted by people.

                As we went around the class to stick stickers, I got to see what my classmates responded to within my
                mindmap as well.

                  I noticed that people resonated with the part about technology (UFOs) being viewed as a technological
                  angel, and also as a <b>sacred text to be read</b>.
                  This further cemented two parts that I wanted to further my research and design narrative in.
                  <br><br>
                  1. The study of new technology (AI/internet) as a more-than-human entity, the view that it is a higher
                  being. <br><br>
                  2. The view that information that we consume on the internet serve as spiritual guidance.

                Having identified this "reading the internet", I then started to question further what might be the
                motivations of the receiver when interpreting the "sacred text". When we look for spiritual guidance, do
                we do it out of fear, for comfort, affirmations, or an escape perhaps?
                <br><br>
                I then questioned the ways that this process could be manipulated, or open to misinterpretation. <b>Did
                  I really want to study the ways data is being manipulated on the internet through AI?</b> I felt like
                that would take me down the path of studying the mechanics of the algorithm and data, which was not
                something I felt like I was equipped to do. <b>Rather, I would prefer to study the behaviours of people
                  when interacting with the internet in search of spiritual guidance.</b>

              <h1>Divination</h1>
              <p>After a little research and digging, I learnt that I could capture all these thoughts under the
                umbrella
                of divination. That is, <b>the practice of seeking knowledge of the future or the unknown by
                  supernatural
                  means.</b> I would say this is the fundamental practise of all religious or spiritual beliefs, whether
                it comes in the forms of reading the weather, astrology, tarot cards, etc. </p>

                <p>I started thinking about the ways I practise divination on the internet as well (even as I claim to
                  be
                  non-spiritual/religious). I engage with discussions with friends about astrology through the Co-Star
                  app, which tells us what the stars have divined for our day, month, our relationships with friends of
                  other horoscopes, etc. I sometimes hear a song that comes up on shuffle on spotify and go "OMG I was
                  just thinking about that!", even though I probably wasn't. <br><br>
                  Of course, the last example was more of the interpretation of coincidences (a concept that was
                  extensively studied in <b>Carl Jung's theory of Synchonicity</b>), but there's no denying that such
                  casual remarks do tend to manifest in real life behaviours.

                    realm
                    of mystery and magic. Today, technology is our magic, in a sense: As increasingly complex and
                    capable
                    devices fill our lives and begin to perform more and more instantaneous tasks for us, your average

                  The writer posits that when something is magical to us, we develop rituals to create the belief that
                  we
                  can control the uncontrollable and the inexplicable. For instance, we now know that blowing on
                  cartridges may have actually caused more problems than it solved. <b>But because collectively our
                    anecdotal experiences had led us to believe that blowing had some positive effect</b> — it seemed to
                  work, even if it took an unpredictable number of puffs, amid all kinds of other unknown factors — we
                  established a ritual.

              we derive meaning from. How do we make ourselves more aware of these practices so that we can still

              <h2>Signs (2002)</h2>
              <p>
                This week, I came across the movie Signs again. The last time I watched it was probably a decade ago. Watching this movie with this new perspective now, however, was interesting to me. In the excerpt from the left, the protagonist and his brother were having a conversation about how people interpreted the aliens' arrival. Some people viewed it as a bad thing, but others viewed it as a sign of 'salvation', a sign that something larger exists. <br><br>We probably see little signs in most things we do – little moments of instinctive meaning-making. How do we interpret the signs for good or for bad? Why do we interpret them as so?

                Maybe the arrival of the internet is, in a way, an alien invasion. Our phone lights up with new messages from the unknown, asking us to "look out for hot deals", "xxx has sent you a message", etc. The presence of this alien is subtle, always in the background, not always visible, but always providing information for us to make meaning off.<br><br>
                What will we make of this alien presence? Does it come in good will or bad faith, what are its intentions? What is the language it uses to speak to us and what is it communicating?
