                I created a mindmap for the class activity. This time, I delved more into the aspect of neutrality by
                exploring the <b>creator, middle man, and receiver of information.</b> I felt like this made it clearer
                for me to study how spiritual information is created, mediated/manipulated, and then received and
                interpreted by people.

                As we went around the class to stick stickers, I got to see what my classmates responded to within my
                mindmap as well.

                  I noticed that people resonated with the part about technology (UFOs) being viewed as a technological
                  angel, and also as a <b>sacred text to be read</b>.
                  This further cemented two parts that I wanted to further my research and design narrative in.
                  <br><br>
                  1. The study of new technology (AI/internet) as a more-than-human entity, the view that it is a higher
                  being. <br><br>
                  2. The view that information that we consume on the internet serve as spiritual guidance.

                Having identified this "reading the internet", I then started to question further what might be the
                motivations of the receiver when interpreting the "sacred text". When we look for spiritual guidance, do
                we do it out of fear, for comfort, affirmations, or an escape perhaps?
                <br><br>
                I then questioned the ways that this process could be manipulated, or open to misinterpretation. <b>Did
                  I really want to study the ways data is being manipulated on the internet through AI?</b> I felt like
                that would take me down the path of studying the mechanics of the algorithm and data, which was not
                something I felt like I was equipped to do. <b>Rather, I would prefer to study the behaviours of people
                when interacting with the internet in search of spiritual guidance.</b>

            <h1>Divination</h1>
            <p>After a little research and digging, I learnt that I could capture all these thoughts under the umbrella
              of divination. That is, <b>the practice of seeking knowledge of the future or the unknown by supernatural
                means.</b> I would say this is the fundamental practise of all religious or spiritual beliefs, whether
              it comes in the forms of reading the weather, astrology, tarot cards, etc. </p>

              <p>I started thinking about the ways I practise divination on the internet as well (even as I claim to be
                non-spiritual/religious). I engage with discussions with friends about astrology through the Co-Star
                app, which tells us what the stars have divined for our day, month, our relationships with friends of
                other horoscopes, etc. I sometimes hear a song that comes up on shuffle on spotify and go "OMG I was
                just thinking about that!", even though I probably wasn't. <br><br>
                Of course, the last example was more of the interpretation of coincidences (a concept that was
                extensively studied in <b>Carl Jung's theory of Synchonicity</b>), but there's no denying that such
                casual remarks do tend to manifest in real life behaviours.

                  <i>When humans know just a little bit of how something works, the rest of it gets relegated to the
                    realm
                    of mystery and magic. Today, technology is our magic, in a sense: As increasingly complex and
                    capable
                    devices fill our lives and begin to perform more and more instantaneous tasks for us, your average
                    consumer understands less and less about precisely how these miracles are performed.</i>
                  <br><br>
                  The writer posits that when something is magical to us, we develop rituals to create the belief that
                  we
                  can control the uncontrollable and the inexplicable. For instance, we now know that blowing on
                  cartridges may have actually caused more problems than it solved. <b>But because collectively our
                    anecdotal experiences had led us to believe that blowing had some positive effect</b> — it seemed to
                  work, even if it took an unpredictable number of puffs, amid all kinds of other unknown factors — we
                  established a ritual.

            <h2>All that to say, there is a power that belief holds in guiding our behaviours regardless of "rational"
              reasoning, and I believe that technology bears countless practises and rituals from which we draw
              meaning from. As new technology grows everyday, there is a constant creation of new mediums from which
              we derive meaning from. How do we make ourselves more aware of these practices so that we can still
              practice them with criticality?</h2>
