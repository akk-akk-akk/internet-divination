            <h1>Pixel Oracle Website</h1>
            <p>Over the weekend, I was thinking about my pixel oracle experiment and felt there was more I could do with
              it. So I set myself a goal of materialising the system into a website.

                    I started with a brief instructional/explanation on the website. Followed by the interactive portion
                    on the right, in which I had to upload my TeachableMachine model. Then I created a system that
                    allowed the user to upload their own images to receive their reading.

                  <h2>Brief ASCII Rabbithole</h2>
                  <p>I got a little distracted along the way, and thought about how to present the title text "pixel
                    oracle". I wanted to see what it would look like as an ASCII text.

                  </div>
                  <br><br>
                  I then tried placing it where the title text would be, and I couldn't get it to be in the right format
                  on VSCode.
                  <br><br>
                  <img style="max-width:300px; align-self: center;" class="img__stroke"

                  <br><br>
                  At some point, I accidentally pasted the ASCII into the google search bar, and thought it looked
                  pretty cool as a single line. (In fact, what if our searches were visualised as blocks like these,
                  instead of text, almost like morse code?)
                  <br><br>
                  <div class="row">
                    <div class="column">
                      <img class="img__stroke" src="/assets/images/week-10/w10-pixel-4.JPG">

                  </div>
                  <br><br>
                  So, I ended up using the ASCII art as a divider for the page. 
                  <br><br>

                  <br><br>
                  This was a slight digression, but it just got me interested in thinking of the deconstruction of ASCII text, and how it could symbolically hold the meaning of the orginally text, even when pulled apart.

                    Ashley introduced the Pandemonium Model by Oliver Selfridge, a creatural take on explaining a
                    pattern learning system that translates morse code into text. I immediately loved how easy it was to
                    understand simply because it was put into a narrative. However, I started wondering about the use of
                    a demon character and why it was chosen. I found an article, <a
                      href="https://www.noemamag.com/blueprints-of-intelligence/" target="_blank">Blueprints of
                      Intelligence</a>, in which the author discusses the use of creatures, or recognisable entities
                    when discussing AI. <b>Do these analogies really help us understand the technology better, and what
                      are the implications that arise with each new element of imagination we choose?</b>

                  With the recent rise in AI accessibility through tools lke ChatGPT, Midjourney, or even Apple
                  Intelligence, we do not think of AI in the same way we might have a decade ago. Gone are the days
                  where the common perception of AI manifest as robots or circuit boards.
                  <br><br>
                  As AI becomes more complex everyday, the battle to make it more understandable to the general public
                  becomes increasingly important. It is thus important to consider how we represent AI in our practice.

              <p>Following the tutorial, I then experimented with how to work with the screen. It took me a while to
                figure out how to place the wires. I was expecting this to be fairly simple but as one does, I ran into
                a few problems.
                <br><br>
                The backlight was not turning on and I couldn't figure out why. I enlisted to help of ChatGPT, and they
                suggested that I use a library specific for the screen (DFRobot_RGBLCD1602.h) that I was using.

                Additionally, I needed to find out the address of my screen (I'm still not hundred percent sure what
                this means tbh), but essentially the "0x2D" was wrong, and once I switched it to the right one, It
                worked.
