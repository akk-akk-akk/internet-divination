              <h1>Algorithmic Folklore</h1>
              <p>Researcher Gabriele de Seta tells the story of the ‘Crungus’, an imaginary brainchild of comedian Guy
                Kelly and the Dall-e image generator, Craiyon. Further investigation revealed that ‘Crungus’ was a
                made-up word that somehow resulted in the generation of many similar-looking cryptids.

                  <p>
                    Eventually, ‘Crungus’ took on a life of its own. With each new generation of the creature, the
                    creature became more real, generating visions of a life well-lived. Gabriele defines ‘algorithmic
                    folklore’ as the repertoire of genres and practices resulting from the encounter between vernacular
                    creativity and everyday automation’. Indeed, the mythological ‘Crungus’ is yet another manifestation
                    of humanity’s old-world metaphysical longings for myth-creation, and a confirmation that that is
                    something AI can provide.

                  <h2>What does a fish look like?</h2>
                  <p>I wanted to better understand how a bias might be embedded in an AI system. I then came across a
                    paper by Alan F. Blackwell, "Objective Functions: (In)Humanity and Inequity in Artificial
                    Intelligence". The paper took me through what it really meant to be objective or subjective in AI
                    models. He studies how objectivity in AI can be measured, recorded and replicated, and how often
                    that is a near-impossible to ask of an AI. To exercise this new knowledge, I started writing a
                    little story about a fish.
                    <br><br>
                    I must admit, there are some generalisations here, and there are a lot of factors unaccounted for.
                    Regardless, it was a simple exercise that allowed me to understand AI bias better. What if we
                    replaced the word fish with 'criminal'? What does that look like? What if it's replaced with
                    'president'? What if we replaced it with 'gay'? The point here was that we can never really know how
                    an AI will interpret a word, depending on the complexity of the situation.

                      of varying observations (“linear regression”), or assess whether a re-

                <p>
                  In 'The Black Box Society', Pasquale’s framing of opaque AI models as a ‘black box’ paints a good
                  picture of why this is a problem. The black box represents AI model’s opacity and unaccountability,
                  highlighting the implications of data-driven decision making. The lack of transparency behind the
                  algorithms that generate our outputs renders this very system as a modern form of divination. The
                  definition of divination varies across cultures, but most refer to the practice of seeking meaning,
                  truth, or direction from non-human sources.

                  Most systems of divination rely on the same formula. Whether it's astrology or tarot reading, the
                  common denominator is belief in a more-than-human guidance. One incomprehensible and more intelligent
                  by man. One with good intentions to provide guidance for the recipient. This brings up a few
                  questions...<br><br>
                  - How ‘rational’ can our algorithms really be? <br>
                  - Is there a future in which we build an infallible belief in AI, mirroring other divinatory
                  practices?<br>
                  - What role does our divinatory instinct have to play in this trajectory? <br>
                  - Will we lose our agency over our decision-
                  making and meaning-making abilities?

                  Of the many implications of such AI agents, this research concerns itself with passive consumption and
                  lack of diversity in information.

                  So, I started drawing a mindmap to try to find something that I could use to bring the old and new
                  together. I was looking for acts of intuition, old and new, that would make the prototype accessible
                  to a younger, post-internet audience. I then started thinking of memes as an everyday internet
                  language. It encompasses most of the qualities I was looking for, intuition, irony, visual – there is
                  so much to unpack!

                <p>Podcast host of The Tarot Diagnosis says, “There’s something about the images that allow our brains
                  to unlock memories and thoughts and feelings. My approach is secular and from a standpoint of self
                  reflection. What can we discover about ourselves?”<br><br>
                  Evidently, the basis of tarot reading is human intuition. The card acts as a mirror from which we draw
                  meaning from, a catalyst for introspection and healing. To a non-believer, this process could be
                  deemed “irrational”. After all, there is no scientific basis to believing a card more for its
                  selection by chance. The foundation for its effectiveness is belief. Belief in its ability to:
                  1. Be impartial
                  2. Be a source of more-than-human knowledge
                  3. Be a tool for healing</p>

                <br><br>
                <p>It has become almost impossible to talk about the internet without memes. The concept of the meme was
                  coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins (1976) as part of a theory that explained why certain
                  ideas, catchphrases, trends, and other pieces of cultural information replicate through a population.
                  <br><br>
                  Whether its images, text, video or just a concept, Internet memes have changed the way we communicate
                  with one another, this phenomena which Cole Stryker calls the “language of memes” and “visual
                  vernacular” that allows people to communicate emotions and opinions. Seemingly inconsequential and
                  humorous, the meme has been a source of study for meaning-making. The humour of memes itself primes
                  itself as a mechanism from which we create symbolic boundaries, who gets it? Is this person’s sense of
                  humour offensive? What does that say about them?
                  <br><br>
                  All this to say that there is much we can say about memes as a medium for interpretation, one that is
                  particularly relevant in the post-internet age.
                  It is simultaneously individual, yet collective.
                  It is innocuous, yet offensive. It is cool, yet
                  cringe. It is rational, yet irrational.

The aim is to spark discussion about intuition and interpretation on the internet. As a language that is so personal, intuitive, and complex, how does an AI interpret such images to decide what it knows about us? It might be easy for the algorithm to hear us say "shoe" and show us a Nike advertisement, but is it able to grasp the more complex elements of our online identity?</b></p>
