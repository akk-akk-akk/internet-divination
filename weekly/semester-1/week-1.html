                <h1>Holiday Reflections</h1>
                <p>
                  Having just come back from a post-exchange holiday in which I was lucky enough to
                  see so much of the
                  world, I started to think about what kind of project I wanted to do in this final
                  year. I gained a lot
                  of insight into what kind of possibilities there were in the world of design. I
                  wanted to reflect on a
                  few things I learnt from my experience in the past semester.

                <p>
                  Particularly, I was inspired by works that incorporated the use of different
                  technologies to craft a
                  narrative. Yuko Mohri's project <i>Decompose</i> stood out to me. She used the
                  moisture level of
                  rotting
                  fruits to control the intensity of lights in the pavillion.

                <p>Having seen design and art in spaces provided by the Biennale also allowed me to get perspective into the importance of space and audience interaction. Considering every aspect of what goes into the experience of the audience really puts the viewer into the perspective of the artist. HAving seen Robert Zhao's works in Singapore before, I was blown away by how different the experience was when I viewed it in the space that his video installations were set in.</p>

            <h1>Slow AI</h1>
            <p>
              Looking through the class slides, I found the AIxDesign community. I was particularly
              intrigued by the
              Slow AI section, that aimed to introduce new ways of thinking about AI, ways that are vastly
              different
              from those we enncounter in everyday lives (algorithmic maximisation of profits, reach,
              etc.) With AI
              being brought up in countless industries as a way to make business more efficient, I really
              resonated
              with the concept of Slow AI as I'm someone who talks a lot about resisting the urge to
              contribute to
              the rat race we all seem to collectively participate in (sometimes against our will).

              Esoteric AI was one way of thinking that I haven't encountered, which is why it was the one
              I was drawn
              to. It was the track of Slow AI that aimed to "[challenge] mainstream perceptions of AI as
              either
              disenchanted or enchanted, proposing alternative ways of seeing, sensing, and knowing AI
              that blur the
              seeming binary of magic and technology. Inspired by feminist philosophy and science and
              technology
              studies, Esoteric AI seeks to trouble the normative understandings of AI and reclaim the
              feminine and
              the enchanted from the dominant ways they are projected onto AI. Just as a séance is a
              collective
              process, so is our reimagining and reenchanting of AI."

              <h1>Belief in the Mystic</h1>
              <p>
                Personally, I've always considered myself a skeptic to anything that I couldn't justify
                with
                science, or hard facts, whether its religion, ghosts, etc. The most I'm willing to
                dabble is in a
                little self-delusion, reading my horoscope to find some kind of validation that I had a
                good day
                ahead of me. I am, however, very fascinated with how people react to things that they
                can't fully
                understand. Watching my mother pray to the Hungry Ghosts every year certain behaviours
                are run by
                feelings and thoughts that are not immediately recognised by ourselves — is it fear,
                respect, or
                just muscle memory?

                    On my trips, I've also seen many many many churches, cathedrals, minsters, that
                    people have
                    dedicated centuries of their lives to building and making beautiful. Regardless
                    of my (non)belief,
                    there is no denying that devotion to the mystical is one of the most powerful
                    drivers of culture and
                    society that we've seen in history — devotion built by the myths surrounding
                    Gods, Heros, etc. Even today, millions of people travel across the world to
                    religious sites to see the beauty of said devotion. Clearly I am not the only
                    one with this fascination.

            <h2>
              This train of thought has me wondering if there are ways I can use historical
              studies of worship,
              beliefs, values, to study the rise of AI in the present. Given how pervasive AI
              is in many of our
              lives now, what if AI becomes a new form of religion to us? (It might seem
              far-fetched, but I think
              there's something here.) How do we respond to this new technology that has taken
              over so much of our lives, and what might we be cautious against?
