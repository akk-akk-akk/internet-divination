              <p>This week we had Ashley from Feelers Feelers come in to share the work that her studio has been
                doing. I actually was surprised by how much of her sharing was aligned with the research I had been
                doing so far, a sentiment shred by many of my peers as well. One of the things that I learnt was
                that, when we think about a certain technology, we should consider not just the effects of it at
                face value, but also the systems behind it.

                    For example, the Jevon's Paradox explains how an increase in efficiency in technology aimed at
                    reducing environmental impact can actually lead to an increase in consumption. One instance
                    where this can be seen is in the increasing reliance on cloud storage. While the intended effect
                    is to reduce the amount of paper used, the environment impact has just been shifted to the
                    immense amounts of energy it takes to maintain cloud storages. Additionally, paper usage has not
                    actually decreased, because the ease of document creation and sharing has led to much more
                    documents being created, and as a result, the amount of hard copies printed remain steady, or
                    increase.
                    <br><br>
                    This is perhaps a relevant example of Anne Balsamo's technoculture, in which she emphasises the
                    importance of studying the cultural effects of new technologies, in order to avoid unintended
                    consequences. This brings me to the importance of thinking about the systems that surround a certain
                    technology. This involves thinking intersectionally, considering more than just the direct impact,
                    but also social-cultural, economic and environmental factors.

                    having Ashley put it in the context of artistic and design practices was eye-opening. When we make
                    websites for example, she listed a bunch of ways that we could reduce the amount of energy use like
                    image sizes, using certain image formats, font file types, etc. <b>As designers, it's easy to get

                    Ashley introduced the Pandemonium Model by Oliver Selfridge, a creatural take on explaining a
                    pattern learning system that translates morse code into text. I immediately loved how easy it was to
                    understand simply because it was put into a narrative. However, I started wondering about the use of
                    a demon character and why it was chosen. I found an article, <a
                      href="https://www.noemamag.com/blueprints-of-intelligence/" target="_blank">Blueprints of
                      Intelligence</a>, in which the author discusses the use of creatures, or recognisable entities
                    when discussing AI. <b>Do these analogies really help us understand the technology better, and what
                      are the implications that arise with each new element of imagination we choose?</b>

                  With the recent rise in AI accessibility through tools lke ChatGPT, Midjourney, or even Apple
                  Intelligence, we do not think of AI in the same way we might have a decade ago. Gone are the days
                  where the common perception of AI manifest as robots or circuit boards.
                  <br><br>
                  As AI becomes more complex everyday, the battle to make it more understandable to the general public
                  becomes increasingly important. It is thus important to consider how we represent AI in our practice.

                  <h2>Question for Ashley</h2>
                  <p>At the end of the talk, I asked Ashley to tell me more about how divination was spoken about in
                    Feelers’ workshop. She talks about how even “secular” entities such as data centres in Singapore
                    turn
                    to fengshui masters/priests(?) for guidance in their architecture.
                    <br><br>
                    <img class="img__stroke" src="/assets/images/week-9/week9-44.jpeg">
                    <br><br>

                    This reminded me of the wall street
                    psychics who assist with market readings through the cosmos. Over lunch, Alda told me about how in
                    her
                    secondary school (a buddhist school), the students were gathered for blessing on a “examination
                    blessing day” for better results. Ashley also talked about how fengshui is used in cable management,
                    which is such an interesting juxtaposition to me.
                    <br><br>
                    I find it interesting how, even in secular communities, especially those associated with data and
                    education (the very things that veer us away from irrationality and uninformed decision
                    making(rephrase), divination is practiced for better outcomes.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>It further proves my theory that this is not a project simply about the metaphysical world. Our
                      mystical impulses of ancestral roots influence our behaviour even in the most unexpected places,
                      much
                      less through our devices, ones that we spend so much time on every single day?</b>
