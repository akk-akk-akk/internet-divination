                            <p>
                                My week started with a book I bought in a bookshop in Barcelona â€” UFO Presences. A
                                documentation of the UFO phenomena in the US, the book "conceptualizes the places where
                                these strange phenomena have transformed their surroundings". Through this alien
                                phenomena, the book studies the development of the world of communications and the
                                image. Through that, the legitimisation of this otherwise mysterious and unknown
                                phenomena. I initially picked it up because of my fascination with UFOs that can be
                                traced back to my hunts for UFO books when I was a little kid (and also the book design
                                was yummy).</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="column">

                                    I never gave the validity of the stories much thought. As a kid, I just fully
                                    immersed
                                    myself in the fantasy of these otherworldly creatures, and the mystery of little
                                    objects, anecdotes, experiences that surrounded them. It was very much the
                                    strangeness
                                    and mystic of these alien creatures and the myths surrounding them that I was drawn
                                    to.
                                    I think I always viewed it as a subject of fiction that is akin to watching a horror
                                    movie. So I was pleasantly surprised to find that <b>this book studied the alien
                                        phenomena
                                        through the lens of media & image production.</b>

                                    It was like understanding that part of my childhood experience, as someone who has
                                    experienced the headspace of (almost) a believer, and now as a skeptic. <b>I wanted
                                        to now see if I could study AI technology through this same lens of cultural

                                value in viewing technology from a spiritual POV.

                                <i>The rise of Catholic-core and occult aesthetics on TikTok seems relevant here too,

                                Purely from a graphic design POV, I thought it was interesting that the kind of visual
                                aesthetics we are drawn to, owing to cultural shifts, has also called out our innate
                                fascination with the spiritual. This allowed me to reflect on how my fascination with
                                this topic did not come from nowhere, it was a shift that I was experiencing together
                                with a broader cultural zeitgeist.

                                    Inspired by the frameworks of Esoteric AI, I started thinking of the ways <b>AI,
                                        Algorithms, and technology could be studied through the same lens of the
                                        enchanted</b>.<br><br> I
                                    thought of how, when it came to unknowable (debatable) subjects like religion and
                                    aliens/UFOs, there was always a way to study human behaviours around them. Why have
                                    people turned to religion as a north star for their way of life, for answers? Why
                                    are
                                    people fascinated with the subject of aliens, even though its something that hasn't
                                    been
                                    legitimately documented?

                                    I also chanced upon this video that held a discussion about the intersection of AI
                                    and
                                    religion. This helped me formulate a few connections between the way people interact
                                    with religion and new AI technologies(right).

                            Then, I started formulating a problem statement that could leave me with a broader research
                            objective.

                        <h2>The sudden rise of AI and algorithmic systems of control have led these technologies to
                            become nearly unavoidable in our everyday lives â€” whether itâ€™s in our TikTok algorithm or
                            seeking therapy advice from ChatGPT. However, the inner workings of AI still remain mostly
                            an enigma to many.
                            It is perhaps unrealistic to expect all users (voluntary or involuntarily) to educate
                            themselves about AI literacy â€“ ways to safely and ethically participate in the system.
                            <br><br>
                            How can I use speculative design & fictional realities to help us make sense of or manage
                            the mysticism around AI?

                                The more I researched, the more I realised that there was already a wealth of discussion
                                about this very topic of AI being viewed as religion, or even used in religion. There
                                are also many projects that have explored AI and algorithms through the lens of
                                spiritual pracices such as Tarot Card readings. It was comforting to know that I wasn't
                                alone in drawing these connections and meant that there were a lot of resources for me
                                to draw on. On the other hand, I felt like whatever connections I made on my own had
                                already been talked about and I didn't know where that left me with the project.

                                For example, in this article, <a
                                    href="https://magazine.tank.tv/issue-82/features/religion" target="_blank"> The
                                    Power of None</a> by Diana Pasulka, she talks about how spiritual information, once
                                derived from religious figures like priests, has been decentralised in the post-internet
                                age. It made complete sense to me that, if humankind has not been able to stop viewing
                                the world through the lens of the spiritual, it would only make sense a place where we
                                spent a large majority of our time â€“Â the internet â€“Â also becomes a space for that to
                                occur.

                                    The exploration of technology as a spiritual vessel has also been explored in media
                                    art since the 60s, a pioneer of which was Nam June Paik, in which he creates
                                    (through installations/performances) discourse around the power of technology to be
                                    a medium for spiritual practices.
