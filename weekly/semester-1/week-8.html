                  <p>This is an old book from 1998, but in my opinion, it contains information that is more relevant than ever. Gnosis simply describes knowledge of spiritual mysteries. Davis traces the history of technological innovations—from the telegraph to the internet—and shows how each has been infused with mystical hopes, spiritual aspirations, and utopian dreams.<br><br>

                  When analysing technoculture, it is then pertinent to consider how spirituality forms part of the new cultures that are created through innovation. With the rise of AI, technology has never been wielded more potential to be an "all-knowing" entity. I am then reminded of <a href="/weekly/semester-1/week-5.html#neoliberalism" target="__blank">Ramey's study of neoliberalism</a> and how the perspective of divination has created new potential for solving problems.

                <p>In today's post-internet society, constant interaction with the internet (some say addiction) has created so many more opportunities for meaning-making that inform the self, our beliefs, values, behaviours, almost constructing our entire worldview – the things we buy, the way we present ourselves, the issues we fight for. Countless articles have been written about this phenomena from a secular POV, but I haven't come across one that speaks to this matter from the POV of divination. <b>Perhaps the reason we keep going back to consuming content on the internet is because of the same reason – that we view this seemingly 'random' arrival of information as the only way we can construct our own worldview, that we need a more-than-human influence to provide guidance. The root of this then goes back to the "the perennial human problem of how to relate to chance as meaningful... what gives the [internet] part of its continuing, if ever-more diffuse and obscure appeal." as Ramey puts it.</b></p>

                <p>She then expands on Geertz's method with her introduction of hermeneutic reverse engineering.
                  <br><br>

                  <i>Working backwards
                    from the construction of a functioning technology, a designer gains
                    useful information for the creation of a novel technological instance. In the
                    application of hermeneutic reverse engineering, what is reverse-engineered
                    are the elements that contribute to the meaning of a given technocultural
                    formation.</i>
                  <br><br>
                  I started drawing parallels with her methodology with those of divination practices. To perform a
                  chicane, the diviner must possess a deep understanding of the signs and symbols to be "manipulated",
                  considering the understanding of the client. They then "reverse-engineer" the process of divination so
                  that they are able to deliver a certain message to the client. <b>With this methodology, I then wonder
                    if I could perform a chicane on divination practices that occur through technology, devices and the
                    internet?</b>

                  <p>The hermeneutic reverse engineering methodology offers ways of acquiring knowledge about elements
                    of signification in a site or object of divination, which is crucial for a practice that is largely
                    informed by the signs and metaphors. This process of acquisition will occur through first-person
                    observations (interactions with devices/the internet) supplemented by secondary resources (existing
                    literature). This will provide the foundation of the making process (rearticulation), starting the
                    self-informing process of prototyping, assessment, iteration, and reflection. This making process
                    will be informed further by the philosophies of speculative design, in which the designing process
                    considers how an artefact embodies and communicates psychological, sociological, or ideological
                    ideas. (Tharp and Tharp 74). The findings from these iterative processes of making and reflection
                    will then be documented in the critical journal, in addition to relevant contextualisation against
                    theories and ideas from my reading list.

                <p>I was a little lost with how to create a first experiment, so I started with something simple that my
                  family has employed in places of prayer. Jiaobei, or moon blocks, are divination tools originating
                  from China. The mechanics are simple, each block producing only 2 outcomes (up or down). When placed
                  together, they make possible 4 outcomes.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="column">
                <p>Shèngjiǎo (聖筊, divine answer): One block flat and another block round is a 'yes' answer.
                  <br><br>
                  Nùjiǎo (怒筊, angry answer) also kūjiao (哭筊, crying answer) or méijiǎo (沒筊, no answer): Both blocks flat
                  facing floor is a 'no' answer. It is said that the gods are displeased or show disagreement with the
                  question, and this is shown in the way the blocks directly fall flat on the floor.
                  <br><br>
                  Xiàojiǎo (笑筊, laughing answer): Both blocks round facing floor have several interpretations; in any
                  case it is said the gods are laughing at the question depending on what has been asked. It can be
                  interpreted as an emphasized 'no' answer, the question that was asked was unclear, or that the answer
                  to the question is obvious. One characteristic of this answer is when the blocks sway back and forth
                  when dropped, a symbolic show of laughter.
                  <br><br>
                  Lìjiǎo (立筊, standing answer): One or both blocks falling but standing erect on the floor (so that the
                  block is standing up on the two pointed ends) indicates that the deities do not understand the
                  referent's question, therefore the question is nullified and the procedure must be repeated.

                <h2>Round 1 – Jiaobei/Moon Blocks</h2>
                <p>My first task was to translate this practise through code in
                  p5js.I found an image generation template that selected images from the library at random, and
                  displayed them in random positions across the screen. I then replaced the images with a block
                  facing up, and another facing down.</p>

              <div class="row padding__top-s">
                <p>I noted that the random positioning of the images were an important signifier in the displayed
                  output. If the images were just generated at the same position every time, they would appear less
                  "real" or "random", as if they were actually thrown on the ground.
                  <br><br>
                  As Anne Balsamo wrote, it is important to observe the "arrangement among signifying elements
                  whereby a unity is produced." In which case, the signifiers here are:
                  <br><br>
                  1. The object (blocks)<br><br>
                  2. The random placement<br><br>
                  3. Text
                  <br><br>—<br><br>
                  The next step in her framework is Interpretation and Articulation, where we draw the lines between
                  signifying elements and context.
                  <br><br>
                  1. The object (blocks) – a form and colour already associated with a belief<br><br>
                  2. The random placement – simulates the physicality of throwing the blocks<br><br>
                  3. Text – describes the divine interpretation according to how it would be traditionally read

                  <p>If I were to present the blocks as a black and white square, it would achieve the same outcome, but
                    it
                    would not bear the visual signifiers present that gives the divination its significance (specific to
                    the
                    individual). If I push this further, I would argue that this mechanism mirrors the way a computer
                    makes
                    decisions through a binary system – one we understand as 1s and 0s. If the binary system is truly
                    left
                    to chance, or instructed so, the computer then becomes an object where divination occurs infinitely.
                  
                  <br><br>
                  This task has allowed me to further understand that there really are endless possibilities of chance that are practised through technology, it is just the re-articulation of signifiers and contexts around the mechanism that allows it to bear meaning. Understanding this will allow me to then re-articulate, or reimagine a possible iteration of this practise.</p>
