                  <p>This is an old book from 1998, but in my opinion, it contains information that is more relevant
                    than ever. Gnosis simply describes knowledge of spiritual mysteries. Davis traces the history of
                    technological innovations—from the telegraph to the internet—and shows how each has been infused
                    with mystical hopes, spiritual aspirations, and utopian dreams.<br><br>

                    When analysing technoculture, it is then pertinent to consider how spirituality forms part of the
                    new cultures that are created through innovation. With the rise of AI, technology has never been
                    wielded more potential to be an "all-knowing" entity. I am then reminded of <a

                      <h2>Divination Runs the Attention Economy</h2>
                      <p>In today's post-internet society, constant interaction with the internet (some say addiction)
                        has created so many more opportunities for meaning-making that inform the self, our beliefs,
                        values, behaviours, almost constructing our entire worldview – the things we buy, the way we
                        present ourselves, the issues we fight for. Countless articles have been written about this
                        phenomena from a secular POV, but I haven't come across one that speaks to this matter from the
                        POV of divination. <b>Perhaps the reason we keep going back to consuming content on the internet
                          is because of the same reason – that we view this seemingly 'random' arrival of information as
                          the only way we can construct our own worldview, that we need a more-than-human influence to
                          provide guidance. The root of this then goes back to the "the perennial human problem of how
                          to relate to chance as meaningful... what gives the [internet] part of its continuing, if
                          ever-more diffuse and obscure appeal." as Ramey puts it.</b>
                        <br><br>
                        Making this link allowed me to gain further clarity over the purpose behind my project. While I
                        identified the issue, I wasn't sure how I could make it 'relatable' to me or my peers. Addiction
                        to our devices owing to our attention economy is definitely something most of us can relate to,
                        conversations about our screen time on Tiktok, Youtube, etc. make apparent the problem our lack
                        of agency over our own interactions with technology. Making the connection between this problem
                        and my research allows me to bring another perspective/dimension to the growing problem amidst
                        AI and algorithmic use of the internet.

              <p>In this pillar, I list off examples of divination in the contexts of larger systems such as <a

                particularly towards the <b>institutionalisation of this practice/impulse, and the intervention of
                  humans in these systems.</b><br><br>I then introduce the <b>chicane</b> to define said human
                intervention in both "ancient/traditional" and "modern" forms of divination.</p>

                devices and interactions with the internet have become spaces for divination. I further explain the way
                our identities, beliefs and values are increasingly influenced by the internet. Particularly in the age
                of algorithmic information technology, we are at risk of our realities being manipulated by external

                particularly with the methodology of hermeneutic reverse engineering. I then detail my readings on
                speculative design as the philosophy that this project will be carried out with. Lastly, tying all this
                back to divinations on technology, and how it can be used as a subject for speculative design.</p>

                <i>The desired outcomes will be a series of discursive design artefacts that aim to accomplish a few

                  <br><br>

                  Firstly, to make the audience aware of their own experiences of divination and meaning-making.<br><br>
                  Secondly, to encourage criticality towards the forces that govern the signs and symbols that they
                  interact with daily.<br><br>
                  Lastly, through the lens of speculative design, explore how divination can be reimagined as a tool for
