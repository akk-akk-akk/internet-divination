                <p>
                  Having understood the value of the image as a signifier from last week's exercise, I wanted to know
                  how
                  this can be interpreted by machine learning. I chanced upon ml5.js, which makes machine learning
                  accessible for beginners.

                  I then realised that it was only getting the answer right when my face was at certain positions on the

                  add more samples of the expression but in different positions.

                  As I was taking samples of my face in different positions, I realised that this was how my iPhone
                  set up my Face ID as well. This blew my mind, because understanding machine learning has always been
                  so
                  impossible for me, but as soon as I did this, it made so much sense. Finding Teachable Machine made
                  the process so much more approachable and easy to understand. It was a good step towards
                  understanding better how machine learning works, and what I could do with it in the future.

                  <br><br>
                  I started with experiment different generations of abstract imagery using p5.js. I ultimately
                  decided
                  to go with just a 1000x1000px canvas (below), each assigned to a binary outcome, black or white. I
                  felt like
                  this embodied the true binary decision-making process of the computer.

                      to the widest audience, because the semantics of the outcome would be catered the most
                      ambiguously. </u>
                    <br><br>

                    So, I turned the epitome of commercial divination — <b>the Magic 8-Ball</b>. I looked up the list of
                    responses that they gave, and selected 3 that tickled my fancy.

                      with no obvious falsifiable detail. The client fills in specific details, crediting the diviner

                      their question is answered.

                  Now that I have my Pixel Oracle designed, I decided to put it to the test. Before that, I had to
                  decide how to put an image in. I thought that, because the machine learned on black and white images,
                  I should stick to a black and white image. So, I created what essentially was an image filter than
                  converts the image into a 1000x1000px canvas of pixels.

                          a
                          threshold of brightness, so presenting the same image darker, or brighter could affect the
                          outcome. BUT, that would also be a result of how the camera decided to capture the image,
                          which
                          would function as a second generator of chance. UNLESS, the client manipulates the image

                  <p> I started with this experiment because it was an exercise for me to create a "new mode of
                    divination" that did not involve any cultural significance. It provided me with a skeleton from
                    which I can build new modes of divinations with, or to understand how to analyse existing modes of
                    divination. Through this, I was able to understand better the roles that the <b>object, input
                      (image/text), code, and output (image/text),</b> plays in a divination system.
                    <br><br>
                    It also evolved into a little design fiction exercise in which I crafted a narrative around my
                    artefact (the Pixel Oracle), a tool which I intend to employ in communicating future artefacts.
