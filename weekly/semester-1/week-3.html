                        <p>This week, we were tasked to bring a product that we have made as a starting point for
                            our FYP. I was unfortunately caught up with work for Singapore Design Week and was
                            unable to produce anything new. However, I decided to bring a project that I worked on
                            for the last semester in DAE as a potential starting point.</p>

                                off as a exploration into our online identities and how they have increasingly become
                                intertwined with our offline identities. Done in a class for trend forecasts, <b>I
                                    studied the trend of NPC simulations on TikTok and theorised that there was an
                                    rising discourse around the agency of our own bodies and others online.</b> </p>

                            a wink, to bringing a potted plant to please the entity. This allowed the audience to step
                            into the shoes of the NPC avatars on the internet, allowing them to question their own
                            interactions with strangers on the internet through an embodied performance.</p>

                                I started my readings about speculative design with the book <b>Speculative
                                    Everything</b> by Dunne and Raby. It was a great starting point for me to understand
                                why people practise speculative design, and they gave me the vocabulary for what I've
                                wanted to do with my practise for a while. I've never been too interested in
                                prioritising user functionality or corporate gain in my designs, but I've always wanted
                                to address issues that I think about daily.
                                <br><br>
                                As the writers put it:
                                <br><br>
                                <i>"Design’s inherent optimism leaves no alternative but it is becoming
                                    clear that many of the challenges we face today are unfixable and that the
                                    only way to overcome them is by changing our values, beliefs, attitudes, and
                                    behavior...This form of design thrives on imagination and aims to
                                    open up new perspectives on what are sometimes called wicked problems, to
                                    create spaces for discussion and debate about alternative ways of being, and
                                    to inspire and encourage people’s imaginations to flow freely. Design
                                    speculations can act as a catalyst for collectively redefining our relationship
                                    to reality."</i>

                                <h2>Man Eat Man Deli — Zine</h2>
                                <p>
                                    I then reflected on a zine that I made for Singapore Art Book Fair in 2023 –
                                    titled "Man
                                    Eat Man Deli". I created this zine during a time where I was consuming a lot of
                                    content
                                    about increasingly divisive opinions on the internet. While opinions seem
                                    incessantly
                                    divisive online, I noticed that having conversations with people who hold
                                    different
                                    opinions from yourself IRL is such an important tool for understanding the
                                    perspective
                                    of others. At the same time, I was also reading up a lot about cannibalism and
                                    how it
                                    was a practise that was extremely divisive (for obvious reasons), despite being
                                    one that
                                    was practised for many reasons in different contexts.
                                    <br><br>
                                <p>My question in creating the zine was therefore:
                                    <br><br><b>If we can study a practise as taboo as cannibalism and understand why
                                        it was
                                        considered "ethical" in certain contexts, why can't we hold that same
                                        respect for
                                        differing opinions that others carry in our daily conversations (especially
                                        those we
                                        see on the internet)?</b>

                                    was my own way of practising speculative design/design fiction. I tried to put
                                    my
                                    thoughts into a context that would be shocking and attention-grabbing, so I was
                                    able to
                                    help the readers understand the message from a different perspective.</p>

                                    The book also discussed different methodologies that artists/designers have used
                                    for
                                    creating fictional worlds (i.e. Utopia/Dystopia, What-Ifs, Extrapolation,)

                                    As exhibited in the project by Matthew Barney, his own understanding of gender
                                    struggles have been extrapolated into a fictional world that is "idiosyncratic

                                    the extreme, an externalization
                                    of his own inner world that can only be aesthetically appreciated by
                                    others. It is art at its purest—noninstrumental, personal, subjective,

                                - What are some metaphors that I can use to craft the narrative?<br><br>
                                - What are the systems/beliefs that I could study to better understand spiritual
                                interactions on the internet?
                                <br><br>
                                I decided to pen my thoughts down into a mind map.

                            <p>This mind map had me thinking about the <b>neutrality of technology/religion as a source
                                    for
                                    the formation of cultural memories.</b> However, I realised that I was jumping the
                                gun by
                                thinking specifically of metaphors and objects, while also being too broad on the kind
                                of spirituality I wanted to look into. So I tried another mind map.</p>

                                <p>In this mind map, I branched out to explore different forms of mysticism that I could
                                    explore like astrology, religion, ufo/aliens, etc. I also identified the subject of
                                    psychology that I could use to understand why people seek spiritual guidance
                                    regardless of the platform/medium.<b>I decided that my study would toe the line of
                                        science and pseudoscience, or what I can identify as "rational" vs
                                        "irrational".</b>
                                    <br><br>
                                    I also wanted to understand better how we "irrationally" and "rationally" interact
                                    with AI – if I positioned AI almost as a more-than-human, all-knowing entity. <b>No
                                        religion is truly neutral, just like no media is truly neutral. We probably know
                                        that no AI is neutral.</b> Predictive AI, for example, is trained on data that
                                    was curated and created by people, who are in no way neutral. This therefore makes
                                    it valuable to understand better how we interact with AI and what we choose to take
                                    from platforms like ChatGPT.

                                    I also thought about the importance of <b>myths and symbols</b> in religions and
                                    cultures.

                                            For instance, the myth of aliens - specifically extraterrestrial life - is
                                            synonymous with alien technology. (UFOs, communication devices, etc.). The
                                            UFO is thought as a symbol in the unconscious of people - invisible until
                                            they are brought into consciousness - even then, the meaning has to be
                                            completed by amplificatory interpretation (using mythological, historical
                                            and cultural parallels to “amplify” the symbols in the unconscious).

                                            <i>“As Carl Jung
                                                described almost 70 years ago, the flying saucer was a new symbol for
                                                the sacred, a
                                                type of technological angel. The UFO is the harbinger of the new
                                                cosmology, the
                                                non-binary, non-hierarchical monistic spirituality of the nones.”</i>

                                meaning from on the internet. Given the rise in memes and aesthetics of the spiritual,
                                are we starting to view more-than-human AI technology as a higher being, a source of
                                superhuman knowledge, spirituality, perhaps?Could I speculate a possible future where
                                the internet/AI is treated with the same reverence as spiritual phenomena of the past?
