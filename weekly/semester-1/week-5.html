                <p>In this video, David Benqué explores the topic of non-neutrality in AI and algorithmic systems. He
                  also introduces the concept of the Chicane, which is a mediation of interpretation in divinatory
                  practices (more on this later). As a designer of diagram studies, he then uses the almanac, a
                  publication that presented order and regularity to farmers through the cosmos in the 1700s, as his
                  object for reimagination. He uses modern data science techniques to reintepret the cosmos for market
                  predictions.

                <div class="column">
                  <p>The term was put into the context of divination by Geoffrey Cornelius, in which he studied the
                    process of "manipulation and trickery" in the healing practices of witch-doctors. He made a few
                    arguments
                    for the chicane in his essay "Chicane: Double-Thinking and Divination among the
                    Witch-Doctors".<br><br>
                    1. The chicane should not be viewed simply as trickery/manipulation.<br><br>
                    2. To perform a chicane requires a complex mediation of <b>signs and symbols</b> of the practise
                    and
                    its
                    client.<br><br>
                    3. Oftentimes, practise divination involves <b>double-thinking</b> – a process in which one hold
                    two
                    opposing beliefs at the same time.
                    <br><br>
                    He suggests that the chicane serves as an invaluable source for hermeneutic studies, relating to
                    wider categories of symbolic interpretations and double-thinking.

                        <h2>Neoliberalist Markets as Divination</h2>
                        <p>In "Neoliberalism as a political theology of chance", Ramey examines the neoliberalist market
                          (free-market capitalism) as a disavowed system of divination. He talks about the market as a
                          system that
                          aims to turn unpredictable human behaviour into ones that can be analysed and used to predict
                          trends
                          – <i>what markets should I invest in? what job career will provide stability and growth? is
                            now the
                            right time to buy/sell property?</i> In this system, algorithms are placed as a
                          'more-than-human'
                          technology to 'predict' human behaviour, positioning it as the diviner. However, we all know
                          that the reality of being in this system serves to keep the people in power, in power.
                          <br><br>

                          <b>In this case study, the value of examining market behaviour through the lens of divination
                            allows him to bring a unique perspective towards understanding why we continue to place our
                            faith in the market system despite malicious behaviour and consequences.</b>
                          <br><br>
                          <i>
                            Even if many neoliberals are beginning to lose their nerve in
                            the face of the climate change catastrophe, political instability, and
                            social upheaval caused by the continuing failure of the global
                            market-state, there is a deeply archaic political problem neoliberal
                            ideology seems to solve, a problem that arguably will not disappear
                            with neoliberalism. That is the perennial human problem of how to
                            relate to chance as meaningful. The apparent solution to this
                            problem, the reduction of chance to mere “noise” in the metainformation
                            processor of markets, gives neoliberalism part of its
                            continuing, if ever-more diffuse and obscure appeal.</i>
                          <br><br>
                          This, which we can view as an instance of double-thinking as the chicane.

                  <p>I reflected all these findings in my RPO and presented it to Andreas on Tuesday. I realised two

                    <br><br>
                    1. <b>I had to find a better way to convey the intersection of technology/divination in my RPO (or
                      all
                      my outputs).</b> I realise it is a pretty niche/abstract topic to be talking about, and as Andreas
                    misinterpreted, it could be simply a project about "chance". It was rather a project about the
                    <b>human impulse</b> to find meaning from said "chance" encounters in technology.
                    <br><br>
                    2. <b>I haven't addressed the design aspect of my research.</b> I got too caught up in the readings
                    on
                    divination as a practice that I haven't started looking into how I was going to approach this topic
                    as
                    a design project.

              <p>My next steps were to tighten up my writings, figuring out the right balance for how much to write
                about
                each pillar. At the moment, my 3 pillars are <b>Divination, Data, Design</b> (catchy 3Ds), but I
                wasn't sure if Data was still going to be one of my pillars, as I reflected last week, I did not think I
                was equipped to or interested in deep diving into data analysis in this project. Perhaps it should be
                replaced by the platform/technology that I am going to study, so that I can better study the signs,
                symbols, and behaviours present in the platform.<br><br>
                I believe that this process of reorganising the RPO will also require me to cut down on excessive
                yapping
                about divination. Perhaps this should go into the introduction as a simpler explanation about how
                divination occurs on the internet. This way, it would be easier for the reader to understand what the
                project is aiming for.<br><br>
                At the same time, I would like to be clearer about how I am going to approach my experimentation,
                through
                what software/techniques? I have a lot of resesarch and interesting anecdotes but I haven't really
                thought
                about how I would carry out my experimentation.</p>

              <h1>Semantics, Materiality of Divination</h1>
              <p>Just as Benqué studied the almanac as a graphic design artefact, I started to identify ways I could
                study
                divination through a graphic design perspective. In "Divination, Material Culture and Chance", David
                Morgan studies the materiality of divination objects and sites.
                <br><br>
                <i>Randomness is the problem and devotional
                  practice is the means to invoke divine assistance
                  as the solution. This usually means conducting
                  an enduring relationship with the other party by
                  means of cult imagery, sacred sites, and a variety
                  of other material forms and practices. Objects
                  and places do not merely signify the relationship,
                  but embody and curate it. Materiality in its many
                  forms is the medium of exchange that maintains
                  an ongoing connection to the powers that can
                  assist human welfare.</i>

                <p>Consider, for example, a spirit or talking board, which combines the hands of
                  participants around a board that moves in a field of letters and numbers. Agency is distributed among
                  the player-clients and the board itself as the planchette travels over the surface of the board.
                  Participants place their fingers on the planchette
                  and pose a query, then engage in an interactive process of involuntary motor reflexes that
                  collectively move the planchette to reveal the response
                  of the “other side” to their question.</p>

                <p>In 13th-century Syria, a brass geomantic instrument combined astrological information with random
                  manipulation of slides to generate binary codes. These codes formed dot patterns, which were
                  interpreted using manuals and dials on the device. The final result, displayed on a rotating dial,
                  aligned lunar information, geomantic figures, and provided answers to a client's queries. </p>

                  material and mechanisms by which each device is built to deliver the message with the reverence it

              <h2>Mind Map Frenzy...</h2>
              <p>After all these readings, I proceeded to organise my thoughts through a series of mind maps that I will
                spare you the deatils on, mostly because I don't think I can explain my exact thought processes at this
                point. However, I will say that after this week, I gained a lot of clarity over the motivations behind
                my exploration of spiritual practices, more specifically divination, on the internet. I was able to
                understand better the audience, themes and processes that encompassed the scope of my project. More
                importantly, I have a clearer picture on how I can frame this curiosity as a design project for me to
                create speculation from.</p>
