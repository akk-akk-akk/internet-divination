                <p>In this video, David Benqué explores the topic of non-neutrality in AI and algorithmic systems. He
                  also introduces the concept of the Chicane, which is a mediation of interpretation in divinatory
                  practices (more on this later). As a designer of diagram studies, he then uses the almanac, a
                  publication that presented order and regularity to farmers through the cosmos in the 1700s, as his
                  object for reimagination. He uses modern data science techniques to reintepret the cosmos for market
                  predictions.

                <div class="column">
                  <p>The term was put into the context of divination by Geoffrey Cornelius, in which he studied the
                    process of "manipulation and trickery" in the healing practices of witch-doctors. He made a few
                    arguments
                    for the chicane in his essay "Chicane: Double-Thinking and Divination among the
                    Witch-Doctors".<br><br>
                    1. The chicane should not be viewed simply as trickery/manipulation.<br><br>
                    2. To perform a chicane requires a complex mediation of <b>signs and symbols</b> of the practise
                    and
                    its
                    client.<br><br>
                    3. Oftentimes, practise divination involves <b>double-thinking</b> – a process in which one hold
                    two
                    opposing beliefs at the same time.
                    <br><br>
                    He suggests that the chicane serves as an invaluable source for hermeneutic studies, relating to
                    wider categories of symbolic interpretations and double-thinking.

                        <h2>Neoliberalist Markets as Divination</h2>
                        <p>In "Neoliberalism as a political theology of chance", Ramey examines the neoliberalist market
                          (free-market capitalism) as a disavowed system of divination. He talks about the market as a
                          system that
                          aims to turn unpredictable human behaviour into ones that can be analysed and used to predict
                          trends
                          – <i>what markets should I invest in? what job career will provide stability and growth? is
                            now the
                            right time to buy/sell property?</i> In this system, algorithms are placed as a
                          'more-than-human'
                          technology to 'predict' human behaviour, positioning it as the diviner. However, we all know
                          that the reality of being in this system serves to keep the people in power, in power.
                          <br><br>

                          <b>In this case study, the value of examining market behaviour through the lens of divination
                            allows him to bring a unique perspective towards understanding why we continue to place our
                            faith in the market system despite malicious behaviour and consequences.</b>
                          <br><br>
                          <i>
                            Even if many neoliberals are beginning to lose their nerve in
                            the face of the climate change catastrophe, political instability, and
                            social upheaval caused by the continuing failure of the global
                            market-state, there is a deeply archaic political problem neoliberal
                            ideology seems to solve, a problem that arguably will not disappear
                            with neoliberalism. That is the perennial human problem of how to
                            relate to chance as meaningful. The apparent solution to this
                            problem, the reduction of chance to mere “noise” in the metainformation
                            processor of markets, gives neoliberalism part of its
                            continuing, if ever-more diffuse and obscure appeal.</i>
                          <br><br>
                          This, which we can view as an instance of double-thinking as the chicane.

                <p>I reflected all these findings in my RPO and presented it to Andreas on Tuesday. I realised two
                  things in the consult:
                  <br><br>
                  1. <b>I had to find a better way to convey the intersection of technology/divination in my RPO (or all
                    my outputs).</b> I realise it is a pretty niche/abstract topic to be talking about, and as Andreas
                  misinterpreted, it could be simply a project about "chance". It was rather a project about the
                  <b>human impulse</b> to find meaning from said "chance" encounters in technology.
                  <br><br>
                  2. <b>I haven't addressed the design aspect of my research.</b> I got too caught up in the readings on
                  divination as a practice that I haven't started looking into how I was going to approach this topic as
                  a design project.

            <p>My next steps were to tighten up my writings, figuring out the right balance for how much to write about
              each pillar. At the moment, my 3 pillars are <b>Divination, Data, Design</b> (catchy 3Ds), but I
              wasn't sure if Data was still going to be one of my pillars, as I reflected last week, I did not think I
              was equipped to or interested in deep diving into data analysis in this project. Perhaps it should be replaced by the platform/technology that I am going to study, so that I can better study the signs, symbols, and behaviours present in the platform.<br><br>
            I believe that this process of reorganising the RPO will also require me to cut down on excessive yapping about divination. Perhaps this should go into the introduction as a simpler explanation about how divination occurs on the internet. This way, it would be easier for the reader to understand what the project is aiming for.<br><br>
            At the same time, I would like to be clearer about how I am going to approach my experimentation, through what software/techniques? I have a lot of resesarch and interesting anecdotes but I haven't really thought about how I would carry out my experimentation.</p>
