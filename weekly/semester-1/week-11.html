              <p>I thought back to my <a href="/weekly/semester-1/week-4.html#rituals" target="__blank">writings about
                  the ritual back in week 4.</a> I believe this could be viewed as a modern "superstition" in which we
                get back what we put out into the universe (in this case, on the internet).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
              <p>
                Some interesting quotes from the article:
                <br><br>
                <i>“There’s a culture of self-deprecation online that I’ve started to reject”</i><br><br>
                <i>"As young people continue to turn away from traditional organised religions, ideas and techniques
                  like manifestation are ultimately getting picked up by Silicon Valley-type apps and
                  companies."</i><br><br>
                <i>"While posting that your job interview will go well or that your ex-boyfriend still definitely “needs
                  you” to ten people are harmless, the premise that everything you consume and engage with online builds
                  your future reality is terrifying."</i><br><br>
                This is yet another example of a well-meaning trend that finds its roots in our old divination
                practices. The article warns of the risks of such trends, as they still allow insidious advertisements
                to use the data we put up for its own gain. It seems only a matter of time before our personal
                manifestations are used by algorithms to sell us a product, or used to manipulate us in other
                ways.<br><br>
                <b>This begs the question, is there a way we can create a self-contained manifestation portal that
                  doesn't rely on the internet?</b>

                  <p>I was reminded of Maya Man's project 'Glance Back' that I found a while ago. The chrome extension
                    gets the user to take a photo of themselves at random moments of the day and type a short caption of
                    what they were doing at the moment.<br><br>
                    The extension served as little interventions through the day to take the user out of the trance that
                    we often fall into while browsing the internet. <b>Man stressed the importance that the images were
                    self-contained and saved to the local storage, making the experience one purely shared by the user
                    and the computer.</b>

                  <p>I also remembered seeing a series of projects by School for Poetic Computation students in which they created a series of "viruses" as interventions. <b>The idea of a virus infiltrating the experience of a user, but turned on its head for positive interventions was so genius to me, and I wanted to see if I could create my own version of that.</b>

                  I got an idea to create an extension that served as a user's personal manifestation platform. One
                  that was self-contained and did not require the user to post it on any online platform.
